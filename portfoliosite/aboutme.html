                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Austin Cartwright. I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I am pursuing a degree in computer science while 
                    also completing a pre-medical track. I plan on working in the computer science field after college and later pursuing 
                    a higher education in medical school. My dream is to one day become a psychiatrist. I have a love for video games, 
                    crafts like working on small computer parts, board games, and being outdoors. If I could be anywhere it would be at 
                    the beach. One of my favorite video games is The Last of Us and one of my favorite board games is Betrayal at House 
                    on the Hill. I have worked on an arduino kit and have learned about things like breadboards, circuits, and chips. I 
                    have a computer at home that I have put together myself which I really enjoyed doing. I also spend some of my free 
                    time playing Magic the Gathering with some of my cousins. I mostly play commander and have many different decks. I am 
                    married and am currently living in Rexburg, Idaho. I am the middle child and have two older brothers and one younger 
                    brother. I have one older sister, and two younger sisters. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
                    Saints. I have lived all my life in Utah, except for my time in Idaho attending college.

                <p>
                    I have developed skills in python, css, and html. I have worked on quite a few small projects in my classes. You can see a 
                    list of the things I have worked on in the <a href="/projects" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a> page. I will continue to 
                    update this section as our learn more languages. Languages I hope and plan on learning is javascript, java, C++, and C#.
