      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Austin Cartwright. I am a student at BYU-Idaho. 
        I am pursuing a degree in computer science while also completing a pre-medical track. I plan on working in the computer science field 
        after college and later pursuing a higher education in medical school. My dream is to one day become a psychiatrist. I have a 
        love for video games, crafts like working on small computer parts, board games, and being outdoors. If I could be anywhere it would be at the beach.  
        One of my favorite video games is The Last of Us and one of my favorite board games is Betrayal at House on the Hill. I have worked on an arduino 
        kit and have learned about things like breadboards, circuits, and chips. I have a computer at home that I have put together myself which I really enjoyed 
        doing. I also spend some of my free time playing Magic the Gathering with some of my cousins. I mostly play commander and have many different decks.
        I am married and am currently living in Rexburg, Idaho. I am the middle child and have two older brothers and one younger brother. 
        I have one older sister, and two younger sisters. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 
        I have lived all my life in Utah, except for my time in Idaho attending college.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked on several small game projects in my classes. I have made a mad libs game, 
        a word guessing game, and a story choice game. In the story choice game I had nested IF statements with prompted choices in the story. 
        It also had code to loop the player back in case they added a wrong choice. 
        Other projects I have done are a meal price calculator, and a temperature converter. I learned valuable functions like IF, FOR, 
        and WHILE statements in python. I have also learned in python math calculations to make the meal price calculator and the temperature converter.
        I have also created a White Water Rafting website and this website. During these website development projects, I learned valuable web development skills 
        like grids, resizing elements, and adding important webpage content. I have worked in both HTML and CSS. On the White Water 
        Rafting site I have added links to other parts of the site and hover effects on the web page elements. I have worked on several 
        teams in my classes and have contributed to several projects.
